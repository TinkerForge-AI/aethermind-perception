# Aethermind Core

**Aethermind Core** is the cognitive architecture for the Aethermind virtual entity.
It consumes multimodal session data (video, audio, actions, and internal thoughts)
generated by the embodiment layer (`experiment-4-embodied-agent`) and implements:

* Temporal segmentation & encoding of experiences
* Good/Bad/Neutral valence scoring
* Memory compression & long‑term store
* Sleep‑phase reflection with internal narration
* (Future) Audio‑based emotional expression and tutor interaction

> _Philosophy_: Grow cognition through lived experience rather than explicit reward maximization.
